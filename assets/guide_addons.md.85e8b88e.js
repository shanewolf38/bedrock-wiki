Addons are very powerful and allow us to create custom entities, items, and blocks, as well as things like custom loot tables and crafting recipes. Your imagination is the limit!</p><p>Addons are primarily written in <a href="./understanding-json.html">json</a>, which is a structured data-format.

Both can function independently, but they are most commonly used together.

This includes things like:</p><ul><li>Textures</li><li>Sounds</li><li>Geometry</li><li>Animations</li><li>Particles</li></ul><h3 id="behavior-pack" tabindex="-1">Behavior Pack <a class="header-anchor" href="#behavior-pack" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>The Behavior Pack, also known as the <em>server</em>, or BP, is responsible for the <em>logic</em> of your addon. This can include things like:</p><ul><li>How your entity acts</li><li>Crafting recipes</li><li>Loot tables</li><li>Custom functions</li></ul><h3 id="communication-between-packs" tabindex="-1">Communication between packs <a class="header-anchor" href="#communication-between-packs" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>In most cases, you will have both a RP and a BP together. These packs can communicate with or will require each other for them to function properly, in the sense that assets defined in one can be accessed in the other. For example, when creating a custom entity, you need two files:</p><ul><li>An RP entity definition, which describes how your entity will <em>look</em></li><li>A BP entity definition, which describes how your entity will <em>act</em></li></ul><h2 id="what-you-have-learned" tabindex="-1">What you have learned <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-you-have-learned" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p><ul><li>Addons modify Minecraft content or add their own</li><li>Addons are written in json</li><li>An addon is split into the <strong>Resource Pack</strong> and the <strong>Behavior Pack</strong>: - Resource Packs contain Textures, Sounds, ... and control how the game looks - Behavior Packs contain entity-files, crafting recipes, ... and control the logic of your game</li></ul></div><h2 id="what-to-do-now" tabindex="-1">What to do now? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-to-do-now" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>',17),h=c("Check out software and preparation page!");function u(m,p,w,f,k,v){const e=r("BButton");return s(),t("div",null,[l,o(e,{link:"/guide/software-preparation.html",color:"blue"},{default:i(()=>[h]),_:1})])}var y=a(d,[["render",u]]);export{g as __pageData,y as default};
